<p>I am a male <i>Homo sapiens</i> living on the third planet in the Solar system. I now work as a post-doc in Nanjing University. My research interests include spectral analyses and radiative hydrodynamic simulations of solar activities. I am also interested in the inversion techniques. </p>

<p>I have a great interest in languages. I speak Chinese Mandarin, Tunxi dialect (Chinese Huizhou branch), and English. I am now learning Japanese through TV shows, animes and dramas. I can also master Engrish (English with a Japanese accent). </p>

<p>I love traveling, especially to a nature reserve or a historical site. I enjoy local food as well as talking with local people. In my spare time, I play Pokémon Go, Crusader Kings, Skyrim, and Diablo III. I am also a fan of Agatha Christie.</p>
